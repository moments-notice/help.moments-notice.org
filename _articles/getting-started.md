The best way to get started is to head over to the [website](https://micahwalter.com/moments-notice) and read all about Moment's Notice. From there you can sign up for the project. This will add you to the project's mailing list and will add you to the queue of invitations. Eventually you'll receive an invitation code which you can use to sign up and get your first roll of film.
